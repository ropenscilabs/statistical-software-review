# Software Life Cycle Statement

<!--- start delete-after-reading section --->

*Please delete this entire paragraph once you have read and understood it.*
Please complete the following statements by filling in all items in angle
brackets ("<...>"), or for sub-points, reducing lists of multiple items down to
the single most applicable item. Note that the markdown characters are escaped
with initial back-slashes which should also be removed. Your repository must
include a copy of this file, also named `lifecycle.md`, generally either in the
root directory of your repository, or in the `inst/` folder. You will need to
add an appropriate entry to your `.Rbuildignore` file to ensure this file is
not included within any distributed versions of your package. This initial
text, and all of the following text within parentheses, are intended to be
removed. Please do your best to provide at least vague estimates for the
quantities requested in the following items: any answer regardless of how vague
is more informative for everybody involved in the system than no answer. You
may also provide additional detail in response to any of the following items,
but please do so by leaving the original phrases intact, and appending
additional information in subsequent sentences.

1. The \<package name\> package has been under development for \<N\> \<months/years\>.

2. The \<package name\> package has \<N\> primary and \<N\> secondary developers.

3. The primary users of the \<package name\> package are envisioned to be \<list
  envisioned user community\>, possibly of the order to
  \<tens/hundreds/thousands\> of users.

4. Following review, the \<package name\> package will

    - \<Be in a stable state of development, with minimal subsequent development
      envisioned\>
    - \<Be in a stable state of development, with active subsequent development
      primarily in response to user feedback.\>
    - \<Be in a stable state of development, with some degree of active
      subsequent development as envisioned by the primary developers.\>
    - \<Be in an initially stable state of development, with a great deal of
      active subsequent development envisioned.\>

5. Following review,
    - \<The primary developer(s) envision being able to maintain the package for
      at least \<N\> years.\>
    - \<The primary developers can envision a potential need to transfer
      package maintenance after \<N\> years.\>

(It may be appropriate to retain versions of both of the preceding statements.)

6. The main factors likely to eventually make the package obsolete or redundant
  are \<list factors here\>. This may happen sometime within \<N\> years following
  review. \<Please elaborate if desired.\>

7. We, the developers of \<package name\>, hope to attain a \<standard, silver,
  gold\> badge at the end of review.

(Note that silver or gold badges require ongoing active maintenance, for which
either the third or fourth items of point 4 must be checked. Note also that
silver should reflect a statement of intent to eventually attain a gold badge,
for which purpose the following statement is also to be completed.)

8. We aim for a silver badge at the end of review, and then aim to attain a
   gold badge via a subsequent round of review \<N\> \<months/years\> later.

(This last item can be left until negotiation with reviewers during the review
process.)
