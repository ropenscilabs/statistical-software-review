# Software Life Cycle Statement

Please complete the following statements by filling in all items in angle
brackets ("<...>"), or for sub-points, reducing lists of multiple items down to
the single most applicable item. Note that the markdown characters are escaped
with initial back-slashes which should also be removed. This initial text, and
all of the following text within parentheses, may be removed.

1. The \<package name\> package has been under development for \<N\> \<months/years\>.

2. The \<package name\> package has \<N\> primary and \<N\> secondary developers.

3. The primary users of the \<package name\> package are envisioned to be \<list
  envisioned user community\>, possibly of the order to
  \<tens/hundreds/thousands\> of users.

4. Following review, the \<package name\> package will

    - \<Be in a stable state of development, with minimal subsequent development
      envisioned\>
    - \<Be in a stable state of development, with active subsequent development
      primarily in response to user feedback.\>
    - \<Be in a stable state of development, with some degree of active
      subsequent development as envisioned by the primary developers.\>
    - \<Be in an initially stable state of development, with a great deal of
      active subsequent development envisioned.\>

5. Following review,
    - \<The primary developer(s) envision being able to maintain the package for
      at least \<N\> years.\>
    - \<The primary developers can envision a potential need to transfer
      package maintenance after \<N\> years.\>

(It may be appropriate to retain versions of both of the preceding statements.)

6. The main factors likely to eventually make the package obsolete or redundant
  are \<list factors here\>. This may happen sometime within \<N\> years following
  review. \<Please elaborate if desired.\>

7. We, the developers of \<package name\>, hope to attain a \<green, silver,
  gold\> badge at the end of review.

(Note that developers who select one of the first two items under the preceding
point 4 can only attain a green badge; silver or gold require ongoing active
maintenance described by the third and fourth items of point 4. Note also that
silver should reflect a statement of intent to eventually attain a gold badge,
for which purpose the following statement is also to be completed.)

8. We aim for a silver badge at the end of review, and then aim to attain a
   gold badge via a subsequent round of review \<N\> \<months/years\> later.
