# Statistical Software Review

Submissions of [statistical software for peer review with
rOpenSci](https://stats-devguide.ropensci.org) may now be made directly to the
main [`software-review`
repository](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review). This is a legacy
repository used only for internal testing of tools and workflows.
