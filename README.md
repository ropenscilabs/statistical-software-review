# Statistical Software Review

This repository is primarily intended for submissions to rOpenSciâ€™s
expanded system of software peer review to encompass statistical
software. The documents of the project, including standards and
procedures which will be used to guide the process, are in the
[Statistical Software Peer Review
Book](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/statistical-software-review-book/index.html).

That book contains complete lists of all current standards to which
statistical software should adhere, along with descriptions of the
processes developers should use to prepare software for submission, and
which reviewers should use to assess software against the standards. The
project-specific [`rssr` package](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/rssr)
provides several functions to aid in these tasks.
