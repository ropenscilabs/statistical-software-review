# Statistical Software Review

This repository is primarily intended for pre-submission enquiries to
rOpenSciâ€™s expanded system of software peer review to encompass statistical
software. The project is documented in the [Statistical Software Peer Review
Book](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/statistical-software-review-book/index.html),
which contains complete lists of all current standards to which statistical
software should adhere, along with descriptions of the processes developers
should use to prepare software for submission, and which reviewers should use
to assess software against the standards.
